## Intro

It all started with a silly thought: can I host my own website in the cheapest way possible? What better way to find out than by experimenting with tools and combinations I had never used before?

I decided it was time to build my own portfolio website to showcase my skills and personal style. I knew I didnâ€™t want to rely on pre-built solutions â€” whether open-source templates or third-party platforms. Instead, I wanted to build everything from scratch, learning as I go, using a mix of technologies, free-tier services, and creative problem-solving.

In this post, Iâ€™ll share my journey of building and hosting my own website â€” from free SSL certificates and DNS management to static hosting on a Google Cloud bucket with App Engine. Iâ€™ll walk through what worked, what didnâ€™t, and how these decisions shaped the architecture of my site.

## The Spark: Why a Portfolio Website?

Every professional needs a space to showcase their work. For me, a portfolio website was not just about visibility â€” it was a perfect excuse to play with new tools, refine old workflows, and build something from scratch. From initial inspiration and architectural planning to designing the layout and writing code â€” the whole process was both fun and educational. And the bonus? I ended up with a site that reflects me.

## Diving into Free Tools: The Research Phase

Once I picked a domain (which Iâ€™m not including here, as your options may differ by region), I began exploring free services and the tools I was curious to try.

Every website needs the basics: hosting, an SSL certificate, and ideally, DNS management. I was surprised by how many services offer these features for free or within generous free tiers.

I already had some experience with things like Letâ€™s Encrypt, but I also wanted to explore new platforms â€” especially Google Cloud, which I hadnâ€™t used extensively before.

## Setting Up Email Forwarding

Since my domain came with free email addresses, I wanted to find a way to use them without paying for email hosting. The simplest and most cost-effective solution? Email forwarding to my existing inbox.

Setting this up was straightforward, although I had to tweak a few DNS settings later in the process to make everything work smoothly.

## Hosting On Google Bucket And App Engine

I explored several options â€” Oracle's free-tier VPS (where I couldâ€™ve used Nginx, like in past projects), Firebase, Heroku, and more. But in the spirit of trying something new, I thought: if Iâ€™m considering Firebase (which is now owned by Google), why not try Google Cloud itself?

## Hurdles Along The Way

Getting started with Google Cloud CLI and navigating their services took some getting used to. Googleâ€™s documentation is great, but the platform is massive. After some trial and error, I managed to set up a static hosting solution using a Google Cloud Storage bucket and an App Engine service.

Next, I connected my custom domain â€” and hereâ€™s where things got a bit tricky. I was also setting up DNS with Cloudflareâ€™s free tier. Since my domain wasnâ€™t registered through Cloudflare or Google, I had to jump through a few hoops to get everything synced. But once the DNS was sorted out, everything worked seamlessly.

Bonus: Google Cloud integrates with Letâ€™s Encrypt, so enabling SSL was just a matter of ticking a box and adjusting a few settings. Super smooth.

I intentionally designed my site as a static website to stay within the free tierâ€™s limitations â€” especially regarding compute time and bandwidth.

## Looking Forward

With the hosting setup ready, all that was left was to build the actual website. I decided to use **React** for the frontend (and originally considered Node.js for the backend, but dropped it since I didnâ€™t need a server side for a static site).

If youâ€™re reading this, then I probably accomplished it ðŸ˜‰.

I took the opportunity to try new tools like **Tailwind CSS**, **highlight.js**, and other libraries. I aimed to build a modular, theme-supporting site (with cookie-based preferences) that I personally enjoy visiting.

## Final Thoughts

If youâ€™re thinking about creating your own website, I highly recommend experimenting with free tools and platforms. Youâ€™ll save money, yes â€” but more importantly, youâ€™ll gain valuable insights into modern web technologies and how to mix and match them to build something unique.

**Happy building!**
